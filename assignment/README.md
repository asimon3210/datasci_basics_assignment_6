Assignment 6
---

Fork and clone this week's repository. 

 1. Create a new `conda` environment for this week's assignment with `environment.yml` file. 
 2. Add your new `conda` environment as a jupyter kernel, so it's visible in jupyter notebooks: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=pytest3`.
 3. Create a new branch named `submission`, and work on this assignment in that branch with the new `conda` environment active. 
 4. Start doing the assignment with `code`(vscode), `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`, opening up `assignment/process_csv.ipynb` and follow the instructions to complete the assignment.
